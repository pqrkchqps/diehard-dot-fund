## Setting up Diehard_Fund on Ubuntu Linux based VPS's.

This guide assumes that you have a little bit of experience using ssh, git and linux and can provision your own VPS or server. I've also assumed that you have a domain name for your Diehard_Fund install figured out. Something like `diehard_fund.myexistingdomainname.com` will be fine. Good luck, and I hope that you find everything straight forward. If you have problems the appropriate place to ask for help is the [installing Diehard_Fund group](https://www.diehard_fund.org/g/C7I2YAPN/diehard_fund-community-installing-diehard_fund) in the Diehard_Fund Community. You can expect that setting up Diehard_Fund will take 2 to 4 hours to complete.
